# Task: #

* Try to understand the sub-problem SAPIEN is trying to solve

* Use new tools to solve that same problem

* Re-assess the papers 

* Narrow down 

* Come up with an analogy between a High-Quality Point Cloud and a RGB-Depth Scan 

## Note on convertability between RGB-D and Pointclouds: ##

* Both describe points in 3D space

* Difference lies in quality of 3D points

* Ground Truth captured by a real "Depth Camera"

* Laser produces much more accurate results but it's a qualitatively different instrument. 

* Cameras produce **partial** depth scans - they're good approximations but not as accurate as lasers (faster tho)
